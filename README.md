## Rules ##

* The game starts with the board in the double bongcloud position with only kings and pawns
* Pawns move (and capture) according to the same rules as with standard chess (barring en passant) as well as nothing happening when they reach their end rank
* Kings can move 1 space but only in its color's pawn direction or sideways (n shape)
* The win-states are when `the opponentâ€™s king is captured` or when `the king reaches the end of the board`
* Due to white moving first it's a draw if black reaches the end the move after white i.e. black on 7th rank white on 1st
* Threefold repetition: game considered drawn if the same position occurs 3 times
